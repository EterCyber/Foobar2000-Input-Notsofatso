### Overview

NotSo Fatso plays standard NSF files. NotSo strives to be as accurate as possible, while still being quick. All expansion chips are emulated.

NotSo provides several options not available in other NSF players, such as stereo output with channel panning control and pseudo-surround sound effects, silence detection, configuarable sound filters, and much more.

### Status

Add FamiTracker support (for debugging only).

The configuration interface is all ported to Foobar2000.

Use Foobar2000's native method to manage subsongs.

Remove the problematic DFC wrapper class and implement it in a standard way.
