## Overview

> Accurate NSF (Nintendo Sound Format) file player.<br>
> NotSo Fatso plays standard NSF files, as well as NSFE files. NotSo strives to be as accurate as possible, while still being quick. All expansion chips are emulated.<br>
> NotSo provides several options not available in other NSF players, such as stereo output with channel panning control and pseudo-surround sound effects, silence detection, configuarable sound filters, and much more.<br>

## Current Status
> The configuration interface is all ported to Foobar2000.<br>
> Use Foobar2000's native method to manage subsongs.<br>
> Remove the problematic DFC wrapper class and implement it in a standard way.<br>
> There may be some problems with NSFE format compatibility, I rarely use NSFE files so I'm not sure about compatibility.<br>
